## 🌟 About

I'm developing this project as an **automation tool for websites** that lets you create automations **without writing any code**, **without using Selenium**, and **without triggering bot detections**..

## 🛠️ Installation

[You can click here for install extension!](https://addons.mozilla.org/tr/firefox/addon/website-automation-extension/)
* Or
* Download the source code and add manually to your Firefox :)

## 🎯 Future Updates (My Roadmap)

I'm constantly working to improve and expand this project. Here's what I'm focused on next:

* **🌐 Full Localization:** I will translate the entire application into English for broader use.
* **✨ Code Refactoring:** I plan to tidy up and restructure the source codes for better clarity and maintenance.
* **⏰ Scheduling Logic:** I'm implementing a precise scheduling system (like an alarm clock) to control when the automation runs.
* **🔗 Dynamic Forms/API:** I will add an API system (using a local server per automation) to dynamically pre-fill forms.
* **📍 URL Management:** I'm integrating a system to either verify the current URL or to easily open specific links (I still need to decide which one).
